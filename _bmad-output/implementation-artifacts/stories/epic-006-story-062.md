# Story 6.2: Crash Resilience

## Story

As a Learner,
I want the app to handle crashes gracefully,
So that I don't see frozen UIs or lose my account standing.

## Status

ready-for-dev

## Context: What Is Already Built

The following exist and must NOT be recreated:

- **`apps/native/app/call/[room].tsx`** — Full call screen with LiveKit reconnection logic (30s timeout). Has `intentionalDisconnectRef` that distinguishes intentional disconnects from accidental ones. Handles `onDisconnected` event via `handleDisconnected` callback — routes disconnected events based on `intentionalDisconnectRef` + `retryInProgressRef`. When partner disconnects unexpectedly, checks partner metadata for `callEndReason: "partner_ended"` — if absent, routes to `connection_lost`.
- **`apps/native/app/call/ended.tsx`** — End-of-call screen with `END_REASON_MESSAGES` mapping keys to display messages. Existing keys: `connection_lost`, `explicit`, `disconnect`, `timeout`, `partner_ended`. **Does NOT have a `crash` key**. Fallback message is `"The call has ended."`.
- **`apps/native/app/_layout.tsx`** — Root layout with `SessionRestoreGuard`, `CallStateRestoreGuard` (from story 6.1), `TokenRefreshProvider`. **Does NOT wrap content in an `ErrorBoundary`** — unhandled React errors will crash the component tree silently.
- **`apps/native/components/call-state-restore-guard.tsx`** — From story 6.1. On startup, reads persisted call state from SecureStore. If state exists and is not stale (< 30 min), navigates to `/call/ended?reason=connection_lost`. If stale (> 30 min), silently clears and allows normal startup.
- **`apps/native/utils/call-state-storage.ts`** — SecureStore wrapper with 30-min TTL (fixed in story 6.1). `saveCallState` is called when token is received in `[room].tsx`. `clearCallState` is called on all intentional exit paths and sign-out.
- **`apps/native/utils/network-state.ts`** — Network availability check and offline error classifier.
- **Moderation state** — Server-authoritative (from epic 4). Crashes do NOT change moderation state on the server. Account standing is computed server-side from strike events, not crash counts.
- **`app.json`** — Already has `@livekit/react-native-expo-plugin` with foreground service permissions.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] T1: Create ErrorBoundary component (AC 1 — crash shows home screen, not frozen UI)
  - [ ] T1.1: Create `apps/native/components/error-boundary.tsx` — class-based React ErrorBoundary wrapping children. On `componentDidCatch`/`static getDerivedStateFromError`:
    - Log crash metadata via crash-reporter (T3.1)
    - Call `clearCallState()` to prevent stale state recovery
    - Show fallback UI: centered "Something went wrong" message + "Return home" button
  - [ ] T1.2: Wrap `_layout.tsx` content inside ErrorBoundary (outside existing Guards, so errors during guard processing are also caught)
  - [ ] T1.3: "Return home" button navigates via `router.replace("/")` — exits cleanly back to home/drawer
  - [ ] T1.4: Verify moderation state survives crash recovery (no local cache affects it)

- [ ] T2: Graceful call end on partner crash (AC 2 — partner sees "Call ended — connection lost")
  - [ ] T2.1: Add `crash` key to `END_REASON_MESSAGES` in `apps/native/app/call/ended.tsx` mapping to `"Call ended — connection lost"`
  - [ ] T2.2: Verify existing LiveKit disconnect flow: when app crashes mid-call, LiveKit detects participant disconnect → partner's `onParticipantDisconnected` fires → metadata check for `callEndReason: "partner_ended"` absent → routes to `connection_lost`. No code change needed if flow is intact.
  - [ ] T2.3: Add `AppState` listener in root `_layout.tsx` or a dedicated hook to detect when app returns from background mid-call — if call state is stale (from story 6.1's `saveCallState`), navigate to `/call/ended?reason=crash`

- [ ] T3: Create crash logging utility (AC 3 — crash type, app version, OS, device model)
  - [ ] T3.1: Create `apps/native/utils/crash-reporter.ts` with `reportCrash(type: CrashType)`:
    - Capture `crash_type`: `"force_close"` | `"anr"` | `"black_screen"` | `"runtime_error"`
    - Capture `app_version` from `expo-constants` `Constants.expoConfig?.version`
    - Capture `os_version` from `Platform.Version`
    - Capture `device_model` from `Constants.platform?.ios?.model` or `Constants.platform?.android?.model` or `Constants.deviceName`
    - Best-effort log: no throw on failure
  - [ ] T3.2: Wire crash reporter into ErrorBoundary (T1.1) — call `reportCrash("runtime_error")` from `componentDidCatch`
  - [ ] T3.3: Wire crash reporter into AppState crash detection (T2.3) — call `reportCrash("force_close")` when stale call state detected on foreground
  - [ ] T3.4: Write unit tests for `crash-reporter.ts` (Bun test runner, co-located):
    - `crash-reporter.test.ts` — mock `expo-constants` and `react-native` `Platform`, verify each `CrashType` records correct fields, verify graceful handling when native modules throw

- [ ] T4: Document and verify account standing protection (AC 4 — crashes don't affect standing)
  - [ ] T4.1: Confirm moderation state is server-authoritative (epic 4 architecture: `userProfile.moderationState` in PostgreSQL, only changed via strike events from server-side logic)
  - [ ] T4.2: Document in dev notes that crashes do NOT affect account standing — only server-side strike events do. Crashes used for refund auto-approval only (backend concern, no frontend code changes)

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC 1: Crash recovery shows home screen
Given the app crashes mid-call
When I relaunch the app
Then I see the home screen, not a frozen call UI
And my moderation state is unchanged

### AC 2: Partner sees graceful disconnect
Given the app crashes mid-call
When the system detects the crash
Then the call ends gracefully
And my partner sees "Call ended — connection lost"

### AC 3: Crash details logged
Given the app crashes
When the system logs the crash
Then the crash type is recorded (force_close, anr, black_screen)
And app version, OS version, and device model are captured

### AC 4: Account standing unaffected
Given I have multiple crashes
When the system evaluates my account
Then my account standing is not affected
And crashes are used for refund auto-approval only

## Dev Notes

### Block Risks Addressed

- **R-008 (Crash resilience)**: ErrorBoundary (T1) ensures no frozen UI after runtime errors. Crash detection via `AppState` + stale call state (T2.3) ensures crash→graceful-end flow for OS-level kills.
- **R-009 (Logging)**: Crash reporter (T3) captures structured crash metadata. Best-effort (no throw on native module failure). Extensible to cloud logging in future stories.
- **R-011 (Foreground service)**: Already addressed in `app.json` via `@livekit/react-native-expo-plugin` from story 6.1 — LiveKit maintains WebRTC connection while backgrounded.

### Architecture: Crash Recovery Flow (AC 1)

1. App crashes mid-call → React runtime error OR OS kills process
2. **Runtime error path**: ErrorBoundary (T1) catches it → `reportCrash("runtime_error")` → `clearCallState()` → shows fallback UI with "Return home" → user taps → `router.replace("/")`
3. **OS-kill path**: OS kills app → user relaunches → `SessionRestoreGuard` restores session → `CallStateRestoreGuard` reads persisted call state → if not stale (< 30 min), navigates to `/call/ended?reason=connection_lost` (call state was saved by story 6.1's T4.1 on token receipt)
4. **Crashed-while-backgrounded path**: App backgrounded → OS kills → user foregrounds → `CallStateRestoreGuard` on `_layout.tsx` mount detects stale state → same as path 3

### Architecture: Partner Crash Detection (AC 2)

The existing LiveKit architecture already handles this:
1. App crashes → WebRTC connection drops → LiveKit server detects disconnect
2. Partner's `[room].tsx` receives `onParticipantDisconnected` event
3. `handleDisconnected` checks partner metadata for `callEndReason: "partner_ended"`
4. If absent (crash scenario), routes to `connection_lost` end-reason
5. Partner sees "Call ended — connection lost" message (already exists in `ended.tsx`)
6. Subtask T2.1 adds an explicit `crash` key to `END_REASON_MESSAGES` for semantic correctness

### Architecture: Account Standing Protection (AC 4)

No frontend code changes needed. From epic 4 implementation:
- `userProfile.moderationState` is stored in PostgreSQL, modified only by server-side strike logic
- Strike events are recorded in `strikeEvent` table, not crash events
- The frontend reads moderation state from the server on startup; crashes don't corrupt this data
- Crash data (T3) is purely for telemetry/refund decisions — never used in moderation calculation

### Test Framework

Bun built-in test runner (`bun:test`). Run with:
```bash
bun test apps/native/utils/crash-reporter.test.ts
```

### Bare Minimum Requirements Check

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| R-008 Crash resilience | T1, T2 | ErrorBoundary + crash detection |
| R-009 Logging | T3 | Crash reporter with metadata |
| R-011 Foreground service | ✅ Pre-existing | `app.json` from story 6.1 |

## File List

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/stories/epic-006-story-062.md` | NEW — this file |
| `apps/native/components/error-boundary.tsx` | NEW — React ErrorBoundary |
| `apps/native/app/_layout.tsx` | UPDATE — wrap with ErrorBoundary, add AppState listener |
| `apps/native/app/call/ended.tsx` | UPDATE — add `crash` to END_REASON_MESSAGES |
| `apps/native/utils/crash-reporter.ts` | NEW — crash logging utility |
| `apps/native/utils/crash-reporter.test.ts` | NEW — unit tests |

## Dev Agent Record

### Implementation Plan

1. Create `crash-reporter.ts` with typed crash metadata capture
2. Create `error-boundary.tsx` class component with fallback UI
3. Write unit tests for crash-reporter (Bun native module mocking)
4. Update `ended.tsx` — add `crash` end-reason constant
5. Update `_layout.tsx` — wrap content in ErrorBoundary, add AppState listener for crash detection
6. Update `sprint-status.yaml` — `6-2-crash-resilience: backlog` → `ready-for-dev` (done before implementation starts)

### Completion Notes

Story created. All 4 ACs mapped to implementation tasks. AC 4 requires no code changes (server-side architecture from epic 4). Key insight: LiveKit's existing `onParticipantDisconnected` + `intentionalDisconnectRef` already fulfills most of AC 2 — only the `crash` end-reason constant and AppState detection need adding.
